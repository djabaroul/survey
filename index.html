      <div id="tribute-info">
        
        <ul id="list">
          <li>1978, Bryant was born in Philadelphia</li>
           <li>Bryant started playing basketball when he was three,[19] and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up.[20] When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketba</li>
           <li>1996 NBA draft
    Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, "marched over these people</li>
           <li>Adjusting to the NBA (1996–1999)
    Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris.[55] He scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games</li>
           <li>Three-peat (1999–2002)

    Bryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999.[72] After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA,[73] All-Star, and All-Defensive teams</li>
          <li>Coming up short (2002–2004)

    In the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals in an 87–82 loss to the visiting Spurs.[92] On November 1, Bryant recorded a triple-double of 33 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 108–93 win over the LA Clipper</li>
          <li>Scoring records and playoff upsets (2004–2007)
    Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant</li>
          <li>Back on top (2007–2010)
    On May 27, 2007, ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority.[150] Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return to the franchise but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place</li>
          <li>Chasing a sixth championship (2010–2013)

    Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total.[201] The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games.[202] In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points</li>

    Bryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season.[316] He also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[317] Bryant was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003 but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries <br/>
